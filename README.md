DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics
Project Overview
This project is aimed at conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics. The analysis focuses on deriving actionable insights from customer, product, sales, and store data, along with currency exchange rates. These insights are intended to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth.

Approach
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handle missing values and correct data types (e.g., dates, numerical values).
Merge datasets where appropriate (e.g., link sales data with product and customer data).
Load the cleaned data into an SQL database by creating tables for each dataset and using SQL INSERT statements.
2. SQL Queries for Insights
Formulate and execute 10 SQL queries to extract key insights, addressing business questions like customer demographics, sales trends, and product performance.
3. Power BI/Tableau Visualization
Connect SQL to Power BI/Tableau and create interactive dashboards for visualizing the results.
